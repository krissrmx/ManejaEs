    <title>Official Arkansas Driver License Practice Test</title>
    <description>The practice test generates 25 questions randomly chosen from a larger group of questions extracted from the Arkansas State Police driver license knowledge test and questions from the Arkansas State Police Driver License Study Guide.

The study guide provided by the Arkansas State Police is the exclusive fundamental source of information needed to pass the driver license written test.

This practice quiz is not a substitute for the study guide booklet.

If a test applicant expects to pass the actual test administered by the state police, it will be necessary for the applicant to read the study guide and completely comprehend the rules of the road.

You can repeat the practice test as often as you want. Each new test will generate another set of 25 questions.

Once you have finished, a screen will appear showing your test results.</description>
    <notice>The practice quiz is only a resource tool used to enhance the applicant’s study preparations.  Applicants must read the study guide if they expect to pass the actual test.</notice>
